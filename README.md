# Still Image to Animated Image Converter 🖼️➡️🎬

Convert still images into animated sequences with ease using GLFW and C++.

## Overview ℹ️

This project aims to bridge static and dynamic imagery by converting still images into animated sequences. It utilizes GLFW, a powerful library for creating OpenGL contexts, to provide a user-friendly graphical interface for manipulating images and creating animations.

## Features ✨

- **Effortless Animation**: Easily add dynamic elements like moving clouds, rippling water, and lighting effects to still images.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Runs smoothly on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.
- **Simple Customization**: Customize animations and effects to suit your creative vision.
- **Sound Integration**: Includes Pygame for sound playback integration to enhance interactive experiences.

## Dependencies 🛠️

- **GLFW**: Handles window creation and OpenGL context management.
- **Pygame**: Provides sound playback capabilities and additional functionality for interactive applications.

## Usage 🖱️

1. **Load Image**: Use the interface to load your desired still image.
2. **Add Animations**: Choose from available animations (clouds, water, etc.) and customize parameters.
3. **Preview and Export**: Preview the animated sequence and export it in your desired format.

## Structure 📂

- **main.cpp**: Contains the main application code integrating GLFW and Pygame.
- **textures/**: Stores image textures used for animations.
- **assets/**: Includes additional resources like sound files for Pygame integration.
- **docs/**: Documentation files including this README.

## Acknowledgements 🙏

- **GLFW**: Open-source library for OpenGL context management.
- **Pygame**: Python modules for game development and multimedia applications.
